    <h2>Top Rated Lighthouse: Yaquina Head Lighthouse</h2>
    <h4>Score: 47/50</h4>
    <p>Example scoring and justifications</p>
    <div class="grid">
      <img src="images/YaquinaHead.jpg" alt="A black and white lighthouse on a grassy seaside cliff against a streaked sky" 
        style="width:50%;">
      <div>
        <h5>Craginess/Windswept: 5</h5>
        <p>Very craggy, very windy, very Pacific Northwest, weird rock right in front of it 
          so there are crazy waves</p>
        <h5>Sorrow: 5</h5>
        <p>Lonely and weary, definite sorrow but in an understated way</p>
        <h5>Height-to-Width Ratio: 4</h5>
        <p>I wish it were just a wee bit taller, but it is the tallest lighthouse in Oregon 
          so that might be too much</p>
        <h5>Interesting History: 5</h5>
        <p>Took forever to build because materials kept getting delayed, the building 
          next door was struck by lightning in 1920, in 1998 a dog named Buddy fell down 
          the slippery cliff but somehow managed to climb back up uninjured before he could be rescued</p>
        <h5>Likelihood of Being Haunted: 5</h5>
        <p>Legend says a worker fell through the scaffolding and died where his body could 
          not be retrieved during building, another legend says that an assistant keeper 
          died because he had to try to light the light while ill (the head keeper was out 
          and the other keeper was drunk), reported ghosts but not after the end of WWII</p>
        <h5>Name of First Lighthouse Keeper: 5</h5>
        <p>Fayette S. Crosby</p>
        <h5>Lens Size: 5</h5>
        <p>1st order Fresnel still active!</p>
        <h5>Quirkiness: 3</h5>
        <p>Pretty conventional but incredibly glamorous</p>
        <h5>Design Choices: 5</h5>
        <p>The black and white is really working for it, love the little entry house, very good</p>
        <h5>Additional Subjective Points: 5</h5>
        <p>This is a very good lighthouse</p>
